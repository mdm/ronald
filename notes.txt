CRTC
----

* where is the character rom located? inside the gate array? - no character rom just raw pixels
* are there 18 or 19 registers? 18 - the extra one is the pointer to the selected register
* skip interlace modes for first implementation
* Whenever the microprocessor writes to R12 and R13, the Linear Address Generator is updated at the start of the next vertical frame.
* Which refresh addresses provided during hsync? see datasheet ("during")
* HSYNC is not defined until R2 is programmed


Debugger
--------

* Break on bus communication


Architecture
------------

* Use Rc<RefCell>s and interior mutability


TODO
----

* Add timing for instructions targeting IXH, IXL, IYH, and IYL
* Implement missing instructions in CPU
* Implement HALT (re-executed until next interrupt)
* Update I and R registers as necessary

Next Steps
----------

* Implement PPI
* Implement debugger
  * Basic break points
  * Step/run command
  * State inspection commands
* Add screen output to gate array
* Tie emulation speed to frame rate
